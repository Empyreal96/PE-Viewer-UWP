# PE Viewer for UWP

<img src="/main.png" alt="main" style="zoom: 50%;" />

## What is it?

As a way to learn some better C# I started a small tool that views various info on .exe and .dll files, information like:

- PE DOS Header Info
- Signing and Hash Info
- Debugging Info
- .PDB Symbol Downloading (Official MS files Only)
- Imported and Exported Functions
- Image Header Information



### NOTES

- This will be prerelease for the foreseeable future!
- Expect Exception errors, bugs, issues to occur... I am learning in very little free time!
- This will be Read Only when viewing files, NO modification features are planned
- Feel free to lend a hand, give feedback or just some moral support!
